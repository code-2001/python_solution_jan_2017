###gen_fib_and_print.py
    A program to generate the first n Fibonacci numbers and print
    * 'Buzz' when F(n) is divisible by 3
    * 'Fizz' when F(n) is divisible by 5
    * 'FizzBuzz' when F(n) is divisible by 15
    * 'BuzzFizz' when F(n) is prime
    * F(n) otherwise
    assumption: only one string is printed per 'n' and 15 has priority over divisibility by 3 or 5.
